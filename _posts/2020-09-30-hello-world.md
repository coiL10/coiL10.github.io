Hi everyone ! Thanks for passing by.

I just finished my Master at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/fr/) and decided to start a blog to document my journey and learnings from this point onwards. :)

During my master, I specialized in Data Science (Machine learning, data analytics etc...) but I would love to get my software engineering skills back on track.

I'm going to try to post as much as I can !




See you soon !
